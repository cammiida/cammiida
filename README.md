ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a PWA for train drivers and conductors for the national railway company in Norway. 

ðŸ’› I love to work on all levels of the stack to gain a full oversight over what we're building.

ðŸ’¡ My main technological interests are: 
- JS/TS
- Remix
- Kotlin
- AWS
- Terraform
